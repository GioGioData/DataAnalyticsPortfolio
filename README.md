## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the success of startups using data from the Crunchbase dataset. The goal was to classify startups as successful or not based on key features such as funding rounds, founder education, product diversity, and geographical location. Two models—Logistic Regression and Random Forest—were used, and the results were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. Feature importance analysis provided valuable insights into which factors influence startup success, offering actionable recommendations for investors.
